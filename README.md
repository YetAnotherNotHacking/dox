# Dox exe
This is a simple executable that is able to share the information of the person that runs it and dumps it into a webhook, this is able to be done with requests, which is automaticallt installed. It also is grabbing the file from another repository, under my Hacking Tools repository. 

This is meant to look like a programming error, so if you are able to get it to someone that is not able to see the extension, or you can use RLO (right left overide) and hide the extension, or any other way that you might be doing it, like saving it as a screensaver, it will be able to run the code aither way.

# Credit
This code is hardly unique, but if you use it, please give credit, and remember, if you use this for malicous purposes, I hereby claim that I am not responsible. Use for educational purposes only.
Please also make sure that you are not sharing this and tricking people without them knowing into running it, it is a trojan and it is against the law.
Just if you use my specific exmaple, please just link back to this repo or try and give credit to YetAnotherNotHacking. Thanks.
